            <h2> A startling discovery</h2>
            <p>You and Steve rush to see what's going on, even though you thought it probably isn't a big deal, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Various things were going through your head at those moments. Did she got injured? Maybe she saw something unbelievable? Those kinds of thoughts were racing through your head. You arrive with Steve only to find Diana at the edge of the crater, looking down in disbelief.

                <br><br>
                "What did you call us for?" - You ask

                <br><br>
                "Just look at the bottom of the crater!"

                <br><br>
                You and your buddy look down to see the most unexpected sight you could imagine at that moment: A crashed lander with a flag planted next to it. The flag appears to be red from  afar, but it has been bleached by the sun quite a bit.

                <br><br>
                S "What the hell happened down there?"

                <br><br>
                J "They appear to have landed without any major problems, because there is a flag next to it"

                <br><br>
                S "NASA never sent an expedition here, at least none that I know of"

                <br><br>
                D "We need to contact Houston about this, perhaps they will know something more about it. They can check satellite imagery of this area".

                <br><br>
                S "I don't think so. If we inform them, they will send us down there, and God knows if that thing even came from Earth."

                <br><br>
                D "They need to know about this"

                <br><br>
                S "We are almost finished, we should report back and start the way home! I don't want to be here any longer than I need to. Our oxygen levels are depleting, we may run out of oxygen if we get stuck there, that's a fucking crater we're talking about!"

                <br><br>
                D "I guess that leaves you Joel, to be the deciding factor here."

                <br><br>
                S "Whatever you choose, I will respect it."

                <br><br>
                D "Me too"

                <br><br>
                All of a sudden, you find yourself in the position to choose and what to do. They both said they will respect your decision, but will that be really the case? There is only way to find out.
