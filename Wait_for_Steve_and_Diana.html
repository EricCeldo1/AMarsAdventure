                Steve and Diana come closer to the edge of the crater and lean forward, taking a good look at the bottom of the meteor crater.

                <br><br>
                J "It's a crashed lander, there is a flag planted nearby"

                <br><br>
                D "NASA never sent an expediton here, as far as I know"

                <br><br>
                S "They sure as hell didn't, that flag has red on it, and we don't use these kind of flags"

                <br><br>
                J "What do we do?"

                <br><br>
                D "We inform Houston, that's what we do"

                <br><br>
                S "Oh hell no!"

                <br><br>
                D "Why?

                <br><br>
                S "Because I dont want to stay here any longer than I have to. Knowing them, they will send us down there, and we don't want to start using our reserve oxygen tanks. Its just simply not worth risking your life over."
                <br><br>
                D "Well, I guess that leaves you Joel, to decide here. And know,that I will respect your decision no matter what you choose."
                <br><br>
                S "I may not support your decision, but I will respect it also."
                <br><br>
                A burden of decision has been thrown upon you. You must choose between not telling Houston a thing, and informing them about everything and waiting for their decisions.
