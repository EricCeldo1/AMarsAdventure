            <h2>Leaving the lander and collecting samples</h2>
            <p>
                Upon leaving the lander, you are greeted by an unfamiliar landscape. Mars missions have become a routine by 2035 but they have only used a single spot for landing: the base of Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the Solar sytem. For this expedition, however, NASA has decided to switch things up a bit. The reason for this change was due to the fact that liquid water was discovered here, at the least in the summer. Because its not summer on Mars, the crew won't be examining water, but rather more usual stuff, such as drilling and gathering rocks from deep underground, etc.

                "Joel, can you come here and see this?" - Diana called you through the radio.

                <br><br>
                "I'm coming" - you replied.

                <br><br>
                You come to Diana by jumping, because who wouldn't like the ability to jump high? And now when you have that ability, why not use it to the full potential? You come to the dry riverbed, and see Diana, lost in her thoughts.

                <br><br>
                "Why did you call me?"

                <br><br>
                "I was wondering what effects would finding alien life in water that runs on Mars have on us, Earthlings. It sucks that we didnt come here during summer, that way we could be the first ones to analyze liquid water from beyond the Earth."

                <br><br>
                "Well, the water discovery was only made recently, and NASA wasn't allowed to change the date for the expedition. But the effects of potential alien life findings would be huge. How would religions explain that? It would mean for a fact that life is plentiful in this vast universe."

                <br><br>
                "Hey, you two, stop chatting, we got work to do!" - Steve warned us

                <br><br>
                "Do you want to collect samples here, or by the crater over there?" - Diana asks

                <br><br>
                You look at the pile of rocks here, and then at a similar pile near the big meteor crater about 50 meters from the lander.
