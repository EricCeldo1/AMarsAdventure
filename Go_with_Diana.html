            <h2>Going in with Diana</h2>
            <p>J "I'm going with you, Diana, you can't go in there alone."

                <br><br>
                D "Great, let's get ready then."

                <br><br>
                You and Diana go back to the lander, you both take a 30 minute break to eat and figure out how are you going to do this.

                <br><br>
                J "We don't have parachutes, but the gravity is so weak, the terminal velocity isn't high enough to injure us, so it's safe to jump down there."

                <br><br>
                D "The crater has a staircase-like structure, with lots of smaller cliffs, all the way to the bottom."

                <br><br>
                J "Yeah, if needed we can also take a break there."

                <br><br>
                D "Steve will secure the rope at the edge and we will carry it down with us to the bottom. We won't have problems getting back at all."

                <br><br>
                J "Sounds like we have a plan on how to get there. But what do we do when we actually get there?"

                <br><br>
                D "I have no idea. We take photos, and take some samples of it, the door might be open... We know nothing about this thing." J "Yeah, is suppose we will figure things on the go once we get down there."

                <br><br>
                Steve knocks on the window, signalling that it's time.

                <br><br>
                D "Let's do this."

                <br><br>
                J "I've gotten the emergency oxygen tanks, we are ready."

                <br><br>
                You and Diana step out of the lander, and get to the edge. On the count of 3 you 2 jump down. The gravity is so much lighter that a 15 meter drop takes like 5 seconds. You jump down off the smaller cliffs while having the rope connected to you. Diana does the same. Its only when you are actually inside the crater, you realise how big it actually is. To think that all that was made by a meteor about 5 meters in diameter, is crazy. As you get closer you begin to uncover new details about the lander, such as windows, meaning it was an expedition with human crew. You already figured that out when you saw the flag earlier, but it looks amazing that, whoever sent this, had windows strong enough that they didn't crack, even in space.

                <br><br>
                You get down after 2 minutes of jumping. Diana secures the ropes and you 2 go for the lander. You can see Steve up on the top, waving to you. The flag was behind the lander, so the part that you saw was only to top, because the rest was obscured by the lander. What you and Diana see, blows your mind away. You see a gray swastika in the middle of white circle.

                <br><br>
                D "What in the hell...?"

                <br><br>
                J "That's a Nazi flag, the black swastika has been bleached by the sun, just like the red color."

                <br><br>
                D "I can't believe this. This can't be real."

                <br><br>
                J "I doesn't matter now. We must keep going:"

                <br><br>
                You and Diana walk around the lander, closely examining it. Lost of photos are taken so they can support anything you 2 say to Houston later. Diana decides to go in. You see that the interior of the lander is filled with air, meaning the lander will explode when a hole is breached.

                <br><br>
                J "DON'T DO ANYTHING!"

                <br><br>
                Diana stops just before breaking the window.

                <br><br>
                D "Why?"

                <br><br>
                J "The interior might be filled with air, it's sealed, Any hole will result in a sudden depressurization, an explosion, if you will."

                <br><br>
                D "How do we release that air, if there is any inside?"

                <br><br>
                J "I have an idea, but it is very risky. NASA has always included a rifle in our shuttles. I'm not sure if the rifle is in the shuttle orbiting us, or in the lander. If we get a shot in the window, the air, if there is any, will slowly leak out, thus, no explosion.

                <br><br>
                D "Sound fair enough. Steve needs to check the lander for the rifle. Do know where is it?

                <br><br>
                J "Someone told me it might be underneath the seat, and the buttstock is underneath the other seat."

                <br><br>
                D "Steve, we need your help. Go inside the lander and search underneath all seats. You should find a rifle and a buttstock there.




                <br><br>
                S "Why the hell do you need a rifle?"

                <br><br>
                J "The lander might be under pressure from inside, and we need a safe way to release that pressure from afar."

                <br><br>
                S "Shouldn't we contact Houston before doing something like this?"

                <br><br>
                D "We will, just bring us that rifle."

                <br><br>
                While Steve is looking for the rifle, you and Diana contact Houston.

                <br><br>
                H "So, the lander might be pressurized?

                <br><br>
                D "We are not sure, but we do have a plan how to release the pressure, using a rifle."

                <br><br>
                H "Send us some photos over so we can see in detail if the lander is actually under pressure." Diana sends some photos of the crashed lander from all angles.

                <br><br>
                H "Hmmmmm, our engineers are telling that the cabin is not pressurized. You are allowed to shoot through if you want. Inform us later again. Good luck. Steve has returned to the edge of the crater.

                <br><br>
                S "How the hell do I get this gun down there?"

                <br><br>
                J "Just throw it as far as you can."

                <br><br>
                Steve takes some time to get ready, and then throws the rifle with all of his force. The gun flies through the air for a couple of seconds and lands on a cliff just above you. You climb up and retrieve it.

                <br><br>
                J "Should I do it?"

                <br><br>
                D "You thought of the rifle, you make the decision.
