            <h2>Trying to cover it up</h2>
            <p>J "I agree with Steve. We should shut our mouth and be done with it."

                <br><br>
                Diana is shocked for a second, she thought you will take her side, but after few seconds she calms herself.

                <br><br>
                D "It's a 2vs1, there is nothing I can do."

                <br><br>
                S "Fine then, lets finish up in here and get going."

                <br><br>
                A thought races through your mind. If we dont tell anything and we get home safely, whatever we might say about the lander, won't be taken seriously. But you have made a decision and you are ready to face any potential consequences. After collecting more samples and doing some more chemical experiments, a familiar noise is heard inside your helmet.

                <br><br>
                It's Houston. They are calling us.

                <br><br>
                "What a weird time for them to call us, right when we were about to leave." - You think to yourself All 3 of you answer.

                <br><br>
                H "How is it going up there?"

                <br><br>
                S "We were just finishing up, we are almost ready to go back into the lander and finish this thing"

                <br><br>
                H "I'm afraid you'll have more work to do"

                <br><br>
                The 3 of you look at each other. They might know.

                <br><br>
                H "We have just made a discovey that will change the history textbooks all over the world. We wonder have you seen it yet?"

                <br><br>
                J "Seen what?"

                <br><br>
                H "A crashed lander-like vehicle in the meteor crater near your landing spot. A shade in the shape of a pole is also seen, we assume it's a flag."

                <br><br>
                Again, the 3 of you exchange looks. You are connected and everything you say will be heard loud and clear on Earth, so you cannot communicate by voice about what to say. Steve walks up to you and writes in the Martian dust: Lie - YES or NO? He then adds an X next to the NO section, signalling that he is for telling the truth to Houston, despite him being opposed to it. Diana also proceeds to add an X at the same spot. Its your turn now.

                <br><br>
                You know that your vote doesn't matter all that much, because your friends outnumber you. So, you crouch and add the final X at the NO section. Steve quickly erased the markings with his boot, so it won't be seen by any future expeditions.

                <br><br>
                H "What's taking you so long?"

                <br><br>
                S "It's nothing, we were thinking how to describe the epic proportions of this discovery."

                <br><br>
                H "Well, to do that, you will need more info about it. The President has been informed and we are certain that that thing down there is not of USA origin."

                <br><br>
                J "How did you find out about it anyway?"

                <br><br>
                H "We got updated satellite images of the site. The old ones were taken during a sandstorm, so the crater was not very visible. We have only gotten it about few minutes before you landed. We waited to see will you notice it, and more importantly, will you inform us about it.

                <br><br>
                S "We were just about to..."

                <br><br>
                H "It doesn't matter now. The President has ordered for you to get down and investigate that thing. Take spare oxygen tanks, and make sure you dont run out of it. You will be able to jump down smaller cliffs without injuring yourself, but you will need ropes to get back up. That's what our calculations are saying. Take plenty of photos, and bring some of the stuff back for analysis. Good luck, you'll need it."

                <br><br>
                The 3 of you are now alone, faced with an order to get down there and investigate the unknown vehicle.

                <br><br>
                S "I'm sure as hell not going down there!"

                <br><br>
                D "You heard the order"

                <br><br>
                S "I don't care, I'm not risking my life over some old lander"

                <br><br>
                D "This will change history!"

                <br><br>
                S "I know, but I'm staying here. I can help you get down and secure the ropes when you decide to go back.

                <br><br>
                D "You are stubborn as hell Steve. Joel, what about you? Are you coming? Diana looks at you with a trace of hope in her eyes that you will go with her. And yet again you are the deciding factor.
