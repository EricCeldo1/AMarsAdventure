            <p>J "We should inform them. It's the right thing to do."

                <br><br>
                Steve looks at you with a dissapointed look, like he can already see what's about to happen.

                <br><br>
                S "Fine then. But if they order us to go down there, you sure as hell won't find me down there."

                <br><br>
                D "We'll see about that. Calling Houston now."

                <br><br>
                H "Well, hello there, how is it going? We thought you'll call us when you finish up in there. It doesn't matter, as we already know why are you calling us anyway."

                <br><br>
                J "So you have seen it?"

                <br><br>
                H "Of course we have. We cannot believe we haven't seen it until now. The last somewhat quality satellite photo was taken during a sandstorm when the crater wasn't visible at all. But that's not all. We have a mission for you. The President has ordered that that thing down there needs to be investigated. You can take spare oxygen tanks. You can jump down smaller cliffs without injuring yourself. You can go back when you're finished by ropes. Make sure to take photos and bring some samples home. That's all for now. Good luck."

                <br><br>
                You all exchange looks. Now you are faced with an order from the President to get there and do an investigation.

                <br><br>
                S "I'm sure as hell not going there now"

                <br><br>
                D "That's to be expected, you can help anyways by securing ropes and making sure we don't die when coming back.

                <br><br>
                S "Of course I'll do that, I won't be napping here thats for sure.

                <br><br>
                D "Joel, you coming with me?"

                <br><br>
                She looks at you, and you see that she is hoping that you will go with her. But you have free will, damnit!
