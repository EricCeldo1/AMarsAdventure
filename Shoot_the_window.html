            <h2>Shoot the window</h2>
            <p>J "I'm going to do it."
                <br><br>
                D "Okay. Let's get behind cover."
                <br><br>
                You and Diana go behind some rocks about 50 meters away and you set up the rifle. You lie down and take aim at the window.
                And then you fire. The gun is silent in space but you felt the recoil and saw a hole in the window. Nothing happens. No explosion is seen. J "The air must be leaking out right now."
                After 5 minutes you decide to go in. Your oxygen tank is empty, and you have replaced it with a new one. You use the empty tank to smash through the lander door. It takes some force, but you do it. The interior is in mess, stuff is everywhere. You see a portait of Adolf Hitler hanging. There is some paper that had something written on it, but it can't be read because of the bleaching by the sun. Then you notice a skeleton in a primitive suit. He looks like he's been there a while. His name plate says "Dr. Hans". You and Diana take pictures to support everything you say to Houston later on.
                And then Diana sees a manhole cover in the middle.
                D "Check this out"
                You walk up closer to it and you try to bust the lock, but it doesn't look like it's gonna open.
                J "Let me shoot the lock, take cover!"
                You get in position to shoot the lock and you do it. The lock shatters in lots of smaller pieces. Diana starts to open the door, revealing ladders going down into the darkness.
                J "My tank is leaking!"
                <br><br>
                D "What, how... wait mine is leaking too!
                <br><br>
                J "We need to go up now!"
                <br><br>
                Both of you rush out and start to climb the ropes you set earlier.
                <br><br>
                J "Steve, we need help, it's serious!"
                <br><br>
                S "What's going on?"
                <br><br>
                D "Our oxygen tanks are leaking for some reason, and I have little oxygen left."
                <br><br>
                S "I'm coming down to help you"
                <br><br>
                You and Diana climb up and you are almost at the top when Diana passes out. Steve starts to carry her and takes her to the lander. You start running to the lander, ingoring the warnings you have said to yourself about not running because its wasting oxygen faster. The insticts are more powerful than any warning I suppose. About 20 meters in front of the lander, you pass out. Next thing you remember is Steve contacting Houston.
                <br><br>
                H "How did their tanks leak?"
                <br><br>
                S "I have no idea. They were opening a cover and they saw ladders leading into the darkness. Then they noticed the leak.
                <br><br>
                H "Without oxygen, we have nothing to do on Mars. Start the procedure for takeoff. You are going home."
                <br><br>
                Steve is relieved that you are going home.
                <br><br>
                J "Where are the samples we collected earlier?"
                <br><br>
                S "I have loaded them all into the lander. We don't need to go outside anymore." Joel, start the ignition countdown."
                <br><br>
                J "5, 4, 3, 2, 1"
