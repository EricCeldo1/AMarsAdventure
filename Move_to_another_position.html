            <h2>A startling discovery</h2>
            <p>J "I'll move, you can stay here"

                <br><br>
                D "Great"

                <br><br>
                You move to a new site, where there are some rocks that are easier to collect than just drilling into the surface. You start to collect rocks and putting them into a wheelbarrow of some sort.

                <br><br>
                You also break some rocks in half, doing various chemical tests on the site, to find out the chemical composition of the material, and compare it with the composition of the material on the Olympus Mons site. You start to think about your family, and how much you miss them. After all, you have travelled for 3 months without stopping. They will sure be excited for any Mars rocks you might bring back. You have started to like Diana, you've gotten to know her better in these last 3 months.

                <br><br>
                "Even though I like her very much, I can't cheat on my wife, I have kids for the love of God!. I mean, we can always be friends I'm sure she will find someone for herself" - You start to think.

                <br><br>
                "I wonder how bit that crater is" - You think to yourself. "And I sure as hell can't judge that from this distance, it's too far ".

                <br><br>
                So, driven by your curiosity, you move closer and closer to the crater. As you come closer, a beautiful sight appears before your eyes. A huge crater, about 1 kilometer in diameter and maybe 100 meters deep is revealed. But then, you lose your breath when you look down. A crashed lander with a flag planted nearby is seen. You cannot believe what your eyes are seeing.

                <br><br>
                "This can't be right. NASA never sent an expedition here. And we certainly don't leave stuff like this behind."

                <br><br>
                You fire up the zoom in your helmet, and look down. You can see that the flag has some red on it, but it has been bleached quite a lot. But that's as the zoom will go. The lander is quite a long way down.

                <br><br>
                J "Steve, Diana, come here quick!"

                <br><br>
                D "Why, what's going on?"

                <br><br>
                J "You won't believe your eyes when you see this!"

                <br><br>
                S "We're coming, but it damn well better be something good"

                <br><br>
                J "Oh buddy, it's more than good"
