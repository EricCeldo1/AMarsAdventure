            <h2>Saying here with Steve</h2>
            <p>J "I'll stay here with Steve"

                <br><br>
                Diana looks very disappointed in you, but she accepts your decision.

                <br><br>
                D "Ah well, I cant do anything about your decision."

                <br><br>
                Diana walks into the lander visibly shaken, but you have already made your decision. You and Steve get to work on setting the ropes to make Diana's trip down there easier.

                <br><br>
                S "I honestly thought you will go with Diana, you never fail to surprise me."

                <br><br>
                J "I just don't feel like going in there, and after all, what's the worst thing it can happen to her?"

                <br><br>
                S "I guess you got a point."

                <br><br>
                The ropes are all tied up and ready, Diana walks by carrying extra oxygen tanks and stops by you 2.

                <br><br>
                D "I guess this is it. I'm going in there"

                <br><br>
                J "If you need anything, just call us."

                <br><br>
                D "I sure will"

                <br><br>
                Diana walks up to the edge and leaps down graciously into the abyss. She lands on another cliff, about 30 meters below you and Steve, and she does the same thing until she is at the bottom, near the crashed lander.

                <br><br>
                S "Is everything okay?"

                <br><br>
                D "So far so good."

                <br><br>
                She walks up to the lander, walks behind it to examine the flag and then gasps.

                <br><br>
                D "This is a Nazi flag!

                <br><br>
                S J "What?"

                <br><br>
                D "There is a gray swastika here, it has been bleached by the sun quite alot."

                <br><br>
                S "How in the hell did Nazis get here?"

                <br><br>
                J "I have no freaking idea"

                <br><br>
                D "I'm going in"

                <br><br>
                Diana takes off her empty oxygen tank, and puts on the extra one she brought. She then proceeds to smash the front door with all of her strenght. The door won't open at first, but after some tries, she gets inside. You and Steve lose sight of her.

                <br><br>
                D "Aaaaaaahhhh!!"

                <br><br>
                J "What's going on?"

                <br><br>
                D "There was a skeleton in a primitive suit leaning on the door from the inside."

                <br><br>
                Diana sounds really shaken up, but she continues to describe the things inside.

                <br><br>
                D "It all looks really old. There is a portrait of Hitler,some torn up paper, I can't see anything on it. I'm taking pictures. Wait, there is a cover here in the middle..."

                <br><br>
                S "Try to open it up"

                <br><br>
                Diana sounds like she is struggling to open the manhole cover, but it looks like it won't open.

                <br><br>
                D "I do have a hammer on me, let me try to bust this lock here."

                <br><br>
                After a few tries, a sigh of relief is heard. It looks like she did it.

                <br><br>
                D "What the fuck is this... It leads down into the darkness with ladders... OH NO! My oxygen is running out!"

                <br><br>
                S "Haven't you replaced your empty tank?"

                <br><br>
                D "I did, this new one seems to have a leak somewhere. I only have a few minutes left!"

                <br><br>
                S "Abandon everything, get here fast!"

                <br><br>
                Diana rushes out of the lander, trying to be as calm as possible, trying not to panic, so she doesn't consume more oxygen. You and Steve get about half way down when she starts to climb.

                <br><br>
                J "Don't panic, stay calm, you will make it!"

                <br><br>
                She climbs fast at first but slower and slower as time goes on. When she reaches you and Steve, you two start to carry her while climbing so she doesn't waste any more precious oxygen. You get on top when she passes out. You and Steve gather all your strenght and rush to the lander in order to get her air. You open the door and lay her on the ground just as the room is filled with fresh air. You take her helmet off and she starts gasping for air.

                <br><br>
                S "Thank God you're alive! We're leaving! I will contact Houston."

                <br><br>
                D "I don"t know what happened down there, the tank wasn't leaking, but now it failed all of a sudden."

                <br><br>
                J "It doesn't matter now, you're safe here."

                <br><br>
                S "I've contacted Houston, they have given us the permission. A human life is more valuable to them than some old lander."

                <br><br>
                D "Are all the samples in here?"

                <br><br>
                S "Don't worry, me and Joel packed everything up we don't need to go outside anymore. We hope you will recover in the following 3 months, you have gone through quite alot in there. Joel, start the countdown!"

                <br><br>
