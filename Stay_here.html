                "Fine then" - Diana replied and jumped her way to the other rock pile.

                <br><br>
                You start to collect rocks and putting them into a wheelbarrow of some sort. Rocks collected from the dried riverbed can contain microscopic life, so you collect as much of it as possible. You also break some rocks in half, doing various chemical tests on the site, to find out the chemical composition of the material, and compare it with the composition of the material on the Olympus Mons site. You start to think about your family, and how much you miss them. After all, you have travelled for 3 months without stopping. They will sure be excited for any Mars rocks you might bring back. You have started to like Diana, you've gotten to know her better in these last 3 months.

                <br><br>
                "Even though I like her very much, I can't cheat on my wife, I have kids for the love of God!. I mean, we can always be friends I'm sure she will find someone for herself" - You start to think.

                <br><br>
                After 5 more minutes of collecting samples, and thinking about various stuff, a surprised female sound is heard:

                <br><br>
                "Holy fuck!"

                <br><br>
                "What's going on?" - You and Steve say that sentence at the almost exact time.

                <br><br>
                "You HAVE to see this"

                <br><br>
                "See what?" - Steve asks

                <br><br>
                "I can't explain, you need to see this for yourself, come here now!"
